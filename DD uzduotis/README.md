Hi,
Hope you like my work.
It's mainly backend with minimal styling. For my frontend knowledge check "Atsiskaitymui" project.
Database is just for example.


Import core.sql database.

username: admin		
password: admin

Please use these to log as admin.

Driver's logins are inside admin page.

Logged driver can see ONLY HIS travel details and odometer values are auto-transfered from last known record.


Don't forget to change login details inside db_functions.php file with your mysql server details.
